# Tribute-Page
This is a web page I created as a tribute to Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, one of Indiaâ€™s most inspiring leaders and scientists. Built using just HTML, the page highlights important moments from his life, some of his greatest achievements, and a few of his most powerful quotes.

It's a small project, but it comes from a place of admiration and respect. Hope you like it!
